Hey, I am DÅ¾iugas Syminas! 
To contact me, write to my e-mail: dziugas.syminas@gmail.com
I am currently a student at Kaunas college, learning informational finance systems 
and my goal right now is to finish my studies, which is really great for improving my personality and thinking!
At the moment I know how to use HTML, CSS, JS, C#, but still there is plenty of room to get better at it!
So far my experience with projects is really minimal, but I am planning on doing a pretty big project soon, hope it works out.
